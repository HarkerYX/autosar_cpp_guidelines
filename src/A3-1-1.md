## Rationale

A header file is a file that holds declarations used in more than one
translation unit and acts as an interface between separately compiled parts of
a program. A header file often contains classes, object declarations, enums,
functions, inline functions, templates, typedefs, type aliases and macros.

In particular, a header file is not supposed to contain or produce definitions
of global objects or functions that occupy storage, especially objects that are
not declared “extern” or definitions of functions that are not declared
“inline”.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A3-1-1.hpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
void F1();
// Compliant

extern void F2(); // Compliant
void F3()
{
} // Non-compliant
static inline void F4()
{
} // Compliant
template <typename T>
void F5(T)
{
} // Compliant
std::int32_t a; // Non-compliant
extern std::int32_t b; // Compliant
constexpr static std::int32_t c = 10; // Compliant
namespace ns
{
    constexpr static std::int32_t d = 100; // Compliant
    const static std::int32_t e = 50; // Compliant
    static std::int32_t f; // Non-compliant
    static void F6() noexcept; // Non-compliant
}
```
