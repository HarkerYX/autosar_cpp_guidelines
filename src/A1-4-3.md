> **Rule A1-4-3 (advisory, implementation, automated)**
>
> All code should compile free of compiler warnings.

## Rationale

Compiler warnings provide the earliest tool-supported indication of potential problems
in source code. Developers should not ignore compiler warnings.
Note: Compiler warnings should be turned on to a level matching (as far as possible)
the rules in this document, in particular A1-1-1. A possible enforcement of this rule is
to turn compiler warnings into errors.

Rule A2-3-1 (required, architecture / design / implementation, automated)Only those characters specified in the C++ Language Standard basic
source character set shall be used in the source code.
## Rationale
“The basic source character set consists of 96 characters: the space character, the
control characters representing horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, and new-line,

plus the following 91 graphical characters: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

) < > % : ; . ? * + - / ^ & | ~ ! =, \ " ’

” [C++ Language Standard [3]]
## Exception
It is permitted to use other characters inside the text of a wide string and a UTF-8
encoded string literal.
It is also permitted to use a character @ inside comments. See rule A2-7-3.

```cpp
// $Id: A2-3-1.cpp 307578 2018-02-14 14:46:20Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>

void Fn() noexcept
{
std::int32_t sum = 0; // Compliant
// std::int32_t Â£_value = 10; // Non-compliant
// sum += Â£_value; // Non-compliant
// Variable sum stores Â£ pounds // Non-compliant
}
