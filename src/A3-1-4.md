## Rationale

Although it is possible to declare an array of incomplete type and access its
elements, it is safer to do so when the size of the array can be explicitly
determined.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A3-1-4.hpp 271687 2017-03-23 08:57:35Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
extern std::int32_t array1[]; // Non-compliant
extern std::int32_t array2[42]; // Compliant
```

be stated explicitly or defined implicitly by initialization.
